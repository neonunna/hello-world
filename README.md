## Hello World! Welcome to Nunna’s First Blog
## My story behind publishing web content

### It all started with...
My professional experience is in the PLM domain in a tool called Teamcenter. During the past decade, many enthusiastic bloggers contributed to explaining the basic architecture and customization concepts. However, there is no extension beyond that. The idea is to create a blog and share information on niche concepts related to Teamcenter(TC) and its web client named Active Workspace Client(AWC) which are not documented anywhere else.

### Medium to publish...
To publish the content, initial exploration made me pin down a few ways to achieve that.
- LinkedIn
- Medium
- WordPress
- GoDaddy

### Preparation...
I first thought of equipping myself with the basics of web development i.e. HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. After an enormous search, luckily found an interesting YouTube channel named [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/user/TechGuyWeb). Thanks to Brad Traversy for creating Crash Courses on the latest web technologies, which are a lot better than many online paid courses.

### A final call on medium...
Now I’m ready to create a basic static web page, it's time to eliminate the Medium to publish options. So, dropped LinkedIn/Medium due to their restricted user base and shortlisted WordPress/GoDaddy to create a domain. Even though they are offering domain names at a cheaper price for the first year, dropped out of those since web hosting is a new topic for me and I do not want to risk without proper knowledge. With all options being eliminated, I’m back to square one.

### Last-minute surprise...
With no options left, YouTube came to the rescue again with the information that GitHub is providing GitHub pages to publish static content. Initially I'm under the impression that GitHub is just a distributed Version Control System. Leaving no stone unturned, created a GitHub account under username neonunna and published my First GitHub page hello-world using Jekyll. 

### Twists and Turns...
I have concluded that there won’t be much better content to share other than this one as my first story. It all started with the idea of writing a PLM blog, learning web development using Crash Courses, and finally ended creating GitHub pages. My way of learning is to keep it simple and take one step at a time.
Going forward, I will use my learnings and contribute to writing technical and informational content.
