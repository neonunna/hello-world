## Hello World ! Welcome to Nunna's First Blog : My story behind publishing web content 

### It all started with...
My professional experience is in the PLM domain in a tool called Teamcenter. During the past decade, many enthusiastic bloggers contributed to explaining the basic architecture and customization concepts. However, there is no extension beyond that. My idea is to create a blog and share information on niche concepts related to Teamcenter and Active Workspace Client which are not documented anywhere else.

### Medium to publish...
To publish the content, initial exploration made me pinned down a few ways to achieve that.

- LinkedIn
- Medium
- WordPress
- GoDaddy

### Preparation..
I first thought of equipping myself with the basics of web development i.e HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript. After an enormous search, luckily found an interesting youtube channel named [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/user/TechGuyWeb). Thanks to Brad Traversy for creating Crash Courses on the latest web technologies, which are a lot better than many online paid courses.

### Final call on Medium...
Now I'm ready to create a basic static web page, its time to eliminate the Medium to publish options. So dropped LinkedIn/Medium due to their restricted user base and Shortlisted WordPress/GoDaddy to create a domain.
Even though they are offering domain names at a cheaper price, dropped out of those since web hosting is a new topic for me and I do not want to risk without proper knowledge. With all options being eliminated, back to square one :(

### Last minute surprise..
With no options left, youtube came to the rescue again with GitHub providing GitHub pages to publish static content. Leaving no stone unturned, created a GitHub account and published my First GitHub page hello-world using markdown files.

### What to publish...
I have decided to share my story of this web development struggle with all of you.

### Twists and Turns...
It all started with the idea of PLM blog, Crash Courses, and finally end with GitHub pages. Going forward, I will use my learnings and contribute towards writing technical articles with the knowledge gained in the PLM field.
